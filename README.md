# GltfUtility
Command line utility to manipulate Gltf/Glb files. It's only purpose is providing an easy way of adding mikktspace tangents to GLTF/GLB.
As the only way of doing that - I've found - is through Blender. But it requires too much effort. Especially when you have to deal with many models.

# Installation

# Usage
`nrs-gltf <inputFile> [outputFile] [-t] [-u]`
Both inputFile and outputFile should have either gltf or glb extension.
Flag `-t` generates mikktspace tangents.
Flag `-u` unwinds indices.
